# IaCLab Service

## Description

This service is a part of the IaCLab project, aimed at exploring and mastering
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) technologies. It manages a state between 1 and 5
and exposes an API for its management.

## Development Environment Setup

### Requirements

- `pyenv`
- `pyenv-virtualenv` (optional but recommended for managing virtual
  environments)

### Setting Up `pyenv` and Python Version

Ensure you have `pyenv` installed. If you are using `pyenv-virtualenv`, create a virtual environment for the project:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv <python-version>
```

Replace `<python-version>` with the version of Python you wish to use, for example, `3.11.4`

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application
